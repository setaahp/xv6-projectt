## 📌 Introduction
The goal of this project is to gradually **enhance and customize the xv6 operating system**, a teaching OS based on Unix V6.  
Through this project, we gain practical experience with **operating system concepts** by working directly with kernel-level code.

The development occurs in multiple phases, introducing new features such as:
- System calls  
- Process management improvements  
- Scheduling algorithms  
- And more

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites
To successfully work on this project, you will need the following tools and skills:

- **C Programming** → The xv6 kernel is written in C  
- **Git** → For version control and collaboration  
- **Docker** → Ensures xv6 runs without dependency or compatibility issues

---

## 🎯 Phase 1 Objective
In **Phase 1**, we focus on:

1. Understanding the **structure and source code** of xv6  
2. Implementing a **new system call** inside the kernel

This phase lays the foundation for further extensions and modifications of xv6.

## 📖 About xv6
xv6 is a **simplified, modern re-implementation of Unix Version 6**, originally designed by the MIT teaching team.  
It is widely used in **operating system courses** around the world as an educational tool.

### Why xv6?
- Provides a **clean, minimal, and readable codebase**  
- Allows learners to **experiment with kernel modifications**  
- Supports **easy extension and customization**, perfect for coursework and research

---

## ⭐ Features of xv6
- Minimalistic and modular source code  
- Educational design for understanding OS internals  
- Supports processes, scheduling, memory management, file system, and device interaction  
- Provides a foundation for **adding custom kernel features**

---

## 📂 Project Structure
The xv6 source code is organized into several files, each responsible for a specific area:

- **Process Management** → Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes  
- **Memory Management** → Allocating and mapping memory  
- **File System** → Managing files and directories  
- **System Calls** → Interface for user programs to interact with the kernel  
- **Hardware Interaction** → Device drivers and low-level communication
