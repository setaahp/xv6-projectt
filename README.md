## 📌 Introduction  
The goal of this project is to gradually **enhance and customize the xv6 operating system**, which is a teaching OS based on Unix V6. Through this project, we gain practical experience with operating system concepts by working directly with kernel-level code.  

The project will be developed in several phases, each introducing new features such as system calls, process management improvements, scheduling algorithms, and more.  

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites  
To successfully work on this project, the following tools and skills are required:  

- **C Programming** → The xv6 kernel is written in C.  
- **Git** → Used for version control and team collaboration.  
- **Docker** → Ensures xv6 runs without dependency or compatibility issues.  

---

## 🎯 Phase 1 Objective  
In **Phase 1**, we focus on:  
1. Understanding the **structure and source code** of xv6.  
2. Implementing a **new system call** inside the kernel.  

This phase builds the foundation for later extensions of xv6.

## 📖 About xv6  
xv6 is a **simplified, modern re-implementation of Unix Version 6**, originally designed by the MIT teaching team.  
It is widely used in operating system courses around the world as an educational tool.  

### Why xv6?  
- Provides a **clean, minimal, and readable codebase** for students and OS enthusiasts.  
- Allows learners to **experiment with kernel modifications** and understand theoretical OS concepts through practice.  
- Supports **easy extension and modification**, making it suitable for research and coursework.  

---

## ⭐ Features of xv6  
- Minimalistic and modular source code.  
- Educational design for learning OS internals.  
- Supports processes, scheduling, memory management, file system, and device interaction.  
- Provides a solid foundation for adding custom kernel features.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure  
The xv6 source code is organized into several files, each handling a specific responsibility:  

- **Process Management** → Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes.  
- **Memory Management** → Allocating and mapping memory.  
- **File System** → Managing files and directories.  
- **System Calls** → Interface for user programs to interact with the kernel.  
- **Hardware Interaction** → Device drivers and low-level communication.
